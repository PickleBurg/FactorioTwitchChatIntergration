# FactorioTwitchChatIntergration

1. Generate client ID
For the bot, you may want to create a separate twitch account (alternatively you can just use your current twitch account). Note: you will need Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled for this step.

Go to https://dev.twitch.tv/ and login with this twitch account. Then click Your Console->Register Your Application. Fill in the fields:

name: FactorioChatBot
OAuth Redirect URLs: https://twitchapps.com/tokengen/
Category: Chat Bot
Complete the reCAPTCHA and click save at the bottom. Copy the Client ID and paste it into config.cfg.

2. Changing Factorio RCON settings to host the server locally
If you are hosting the game locally, instead of a dedicated server then follow these instruction. Otherwise if you already have a dedicated server, look up how to enable the RCON interface with a particular port and password.

On the main menu screen, hold Ctrl+Alt and then left click "Settings"
Now select the last item "The rest".
By local-rcon-socket, enter 0.0.0.0:25575
By local-rcon-password, enter my_password (or any secret password, the same one as in settings.txt)
Then click confirm, and go back to the main menu.
Click Multiplayer -> Host a save game
Select the game you want to host.
Click Play
